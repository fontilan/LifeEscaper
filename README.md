This website was built to fulfil the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Project - Build a Product Landing Page.

This is also the first time I was using some vector graphics.

The original challenge required an inclusion of an embedded video, but I felt like it doesn't relly belong, so for this version I decided not to include it.
